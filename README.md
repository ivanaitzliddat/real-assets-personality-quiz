# Real Assets Personality Quiz

A responsive, static React personality quiz that introduces four real-asset archetypes through a playful editorial experience. It is a financial-services marketing/education prototype—not a suitability assessment, recommendation engine, or source of investment advice.

> **Quiz content is actively being refined. Current copy should not be treated as final approved marketing material.**

## Status

The refreshed end-to-end experience includes the branded landing page, six configurable questions, weighted deterministic scoring, four screenshot-ready result designs, development previews, tests, and GitHub Pages deployment automation. Names, descriptions, educational copy, artwork, CTAs, and the tie methodology remain provisional.

## Local setup

Requires Node.js 22+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. Other commands:

```bash
npm run test        # one test run
npm run test:watch  # interactive test watcher
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run preview     # serve the production build locally
```

## Architecture

- **`src/data/`** — replaceable questions, personalities, site labels, CTA, disclaimer, and artwork references.
- **`src/types/quiz.ts`** — stable domain IDs and content contracts.
- **`src/lib/scoring.ts`** — generic score-map summing and result calculation.
- **`src/lib/tieBreaker.ts`** — isolated provisional tie methodology.
- **`src/lib/quizState.ts`** — small tested reducer for navigation and answer state.
- **`src/context/QuizContext.tsx`** — client-only quiz state shared across hash routes.
- **`src/components/`** — reusable presentation components with no marketing decisions.
- **`src/pages/`** — landing, quiz, result, and development preview composition.
- **`public/placeholders/`** — lightweight replaceable local SVG artwork.
- **`tests/`** — scoring, tie, state, content-integrity, and end-to-end component behavior.

The app uses `HashRouter`, so repository-hosted routes work without server rewrites. Direct public results use `#/result/<stable-id>` and contain no user data.

## Editing content

### Questions and answers

Edit `src/data/questions.ts`. Each question must have a stable question ID and exactly four answers. Answer position has no scoring meaning. Put all scoring in the answer’s `scores` map and identify its primary class with `primaryAssetClass`.

```ts
{
  id: 'example-answer',
  text: 'Replaceable answer copy',
  primaryAssetClass: 'real-estate',
  scores: { 'real-estate': 2, infrastructure: 1 },
}
```

Run `npm test` after every content change; integrity tests reject invalid IDs, missing score maps, missing personalities, and incorrect answer counts.

### Personality/result content

Edit `src/data/personalities.ts`. Public names can change without changing stable IDs. Descriptions, traits, educational copy, artwork paths, and optional CTA are all configured there.

### Landing, labels, sharing, and disclaimer

Edit `src/data/siteContent.ts`. The disclaimer is controlled copy; do not rewrite it casually.

### Artwork

Add approved local assets under `public/` and update each personality’s `artwork.hero` path. Avoid remote dependencies. Keep meaningful alt text in configuration. Current illustrations in `public/placeholders/` are intentionally simple and neutral.

## Previewing results

During `npm run dev`:

- `#/dev/results` links to all four complete result states.
- `#/dev/components` shows answers, selected state, progress, result hero, traits, secondary match, CTA, and disclaimer.
- `#/result/real-estate`
- `#/result/infrastructure`
- `#/result/commodities`
- `#/result/natural-resources`

Development preview routes are omitted from production routing. Public result URLs remain available intentionally so shared links can open a result without persisted quiz answers; a direct result does not invent a secondary match.

## Scoring

The engine sums whatever score values exist in selected answers, multiplied by optional question weights. Questions 1–5 currently award one point and question 6 awards two points directly in its answer data. No scoring rule depends on answer order or copy.

The provisional tie logic is documented in `docs/SCORING.md` and isolated in `src/lib/tieBreaker.ts`: final-question preference among tied leaders, then primary-selection counts, then a stable technical order. Percentages are not calculated or displayed.

## GitHub Pages deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` verifies formatting, lint, and tests, builds with the actual repository name as Vite’s base path, and deploys `dist/` through GitHub Pages.

Repository setup:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. Push to `main` or run the **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow manually.

For a repository named `my-quiz`, the expected URL is `https://<owner>.github.io/my-quiz/`. Local development always uses `/`, so it does not depend on a final repository name.

## Project documentation

See `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `CONTENT_MODEL.md`, `SCORING.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `COMPLIANCE.md`, and `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md` for the product boundary and engineering rationale.
